## Trade-wars â€“ PDC adaptation

To run, open directory in console and run ```meteor``` in one terminal tab.

When that's running, run ```meteor mongo``` in the other tab, and copy paste the uncommented contents of setup-console-queries.js. And you should be ready to roll!

Also, don't do meteor update, if it asks you to. I haven't tested if it does break this project, but in my past projects, meteor update broke things far too intensely.
