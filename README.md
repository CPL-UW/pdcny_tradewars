# Lead Caravan

## Enabling base users

If you don't have a file called secrets.js, make any file in the lib/ folder and store a password string in a variable called basePass (basePass = <'something'>). 

The usernames are group-1-base, group-2-base, ...

## Seeing the leaderboard

If you're logged in to the username who's an admin for a game, go to that admin's game page (/<gamecode>), and got to /<gamecode>/cv to look at it!
