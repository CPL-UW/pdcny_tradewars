check balancing of price changing
progress bar not enough; needs to feel more dynamic



----

block making of trades when no other users are around
make read alerts / responded requests header smaller

per year notification to everybody about who won the round

--------------

Ambitious
1. Try adding overlay tutorials
2. When the first time a year ends, try adding a notification telling about popular and polluted resources

More doable:
4. Add colors/icons to polluted and cool resources
5. *** Highlight item being graphed in base station view
6. In warning notification of request received, link it so clicking on it moves you to notifications tab.    OR maybe pop up a modal window
7. 

BUGS:
In Responded requests, status detection of request response is faulty


0. in base station, highlight resource being charted

2. Limit how much individual players can trade, because an individual trader can only carry so much
	Max trade size
3. Individual users carry things: they go to the home base, pick up stuff, and an only trade that out. Need to go back to home base to pick up and drop off things.

Game Mechanics to discuss:
	tariffs in trading
	trading with your own market


Done:
	add username functionality
	disable user editing of profile (don't need to anymore)
	--- Yet to correctly retrieve all possible resources,
	--- write backend queries to actually move resources around, and 
	--- add functionality for raising a “confirm transfer?” dialog with the requested person.
	//
	--- all sendable people right now, are any other user. It should only be users from other groups
