UI Refinements:

Ambitious
1. Try adding overlay tutorials
2. When the first time a year ends, try adding a notification telling about popular and polluted resources

More doable:
3. fix information in menu bar
4. Add colors/icons to polluted and cool resources
5. *** Highlight item being graphed in base station view
6. In warning notification of request received, link it so clicking on it moves you to notifications tab.    OR maybe pop up a modal window
7. 

BUGS:
In Responded requests, status detection of request response is faulty



0. in base station, highlight resource being charted

// done
//~~ done but not verified yet

// 1. raise alert when trade received 
	 increment issue

// 4. in sent request, and request accepted/rejected, show request details

// 2. move clear all alerts button above

// 3. when alert is raised, force scroll up to alert. Or add a hovering thing that shows unread notifications

// 6. add read alerts and read requests box
	add time for corresponding things too

// 5. when request form is entered, clear form

// 7. make stock price change happen when trade occurs




// make central screen display
	// add score functionality for yearly goals


// check that pause and skip year buttons in admin work correctly

--  7. Events

8. (Wonders) Building chairs

9. Invest resources to make better bags, or such



1. Change prices/value of resources depending on physical location of each of the players
2. Limit how much individual players can trade, because an individual trader can only carry so much
	Max trade size
3. Individual users carry things: they go to the home base, pick up stuff, and an only trade that out. Need to go back to home base to pick up and drop off things.

4. Try having achieve goals (people join in for a short time, and try getting some goals)
5. A visible timer for the runout
6. 


TODOS:
	
	make secure

	add event logging


Game Mechanics to discuss:
	tariffs in trading
	trading with your own market


Done:
	add username functionality
	disable user editing of profile (don't need to anymore)
	--- Yet to correctly retrieve all possible resources,
	--- write backend queries to actually move resources around, and 
	--- add functionality for raising a “confirm transfer?” dialog with the requested person.
	//
	--- all sendable people right now, are any other user. It should only be users from other groups
